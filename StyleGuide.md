# Computing Challenge Style Guidelines

This guide should detail the steps used by every participating developer
when they want to post a solution to a new problem.

## Issues:
If you want to start working on a problem, post an issue so that other's know that you have taken 
ownership of that one.  This way we don't waste too much time making duplicate solutions!

For your first problem, open an issue with a descriptive title and a 
brief description of why you are posting it.  This is just to give you an idea of 
what an issue should look like.  

If you are working on fixing an issue, leave a comment taking ownership of fixing it,
give updates/ask for help when you need, and post a link to your PR that aims to fix the issue.
Once you have a PR, most communications regarding the issue will take place on the PR.

In general, issues should be made when an update to the project needs to be made.  

## Pull Requests:
A pull request, referred to as PR, is a way of letting others view your work before merging into master.  
Here are the steps in making and deploying your PR:

1.  Make a descriptive, but brief title i.e. "Updating ECOO 2012 Question 3 to use dictionaries"
2.  Leave a description of what you are doing, why you're doing it, and how your solution does what you purport it to do.
3.  Ping at least 1 other person for code review, so that they can give you ideas and suggestions.
4.  When you've gotten a thumbs up, merge into master, but squash your unnecessary commits first!
