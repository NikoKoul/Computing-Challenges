# Computing-Challenges
A repository of Computing Challenge solutions.  This is a place to keep our attempts and track improvements on solutions. 
I would encourage anyone participating to avoid using `--amend --no-edit` in most cases when committing changes so that we can all see 
the mistakes and changes that we made and use them as a way of improving.
