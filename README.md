# Computing-Challenges
This is a place to keep our attempts and track improvements on solutions. 

##### Visit the [Style Guide](https://github.com/NikoKoul/Computing-Challenges/blob/master/StyleGuide.md) before you begin contributing.

## Canterbury Computer Science Club
Post solutions as pull requests and new problems that you would like to work on as issues.  For our beginners, pair up with a senior so that both of you can learn and develop new skills together.    

I would encourage anyone participating to avoid using `--amend --no-edit` in most cases when committing changes so that we can all see 
the mistakes and changes that we made and use them as a way of improving.  More on that in the style guide.

#### As always, anyone questions, feel free to ping @NikoKoul on Github.
