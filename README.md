# Computing-Challenges
This is a place to keep our attempts and track improvements on solutions. 

## Never commit directly to master!  
##### Visit the [Style Guide](https://github.com/NikoKoul/Computing-Challenges/blob/master/StyleGuide.md) for more on how to contribute!

I would encourage anyone participating to avoid using `--amend --no-edit` in most cases when committing changes so that we can all see 
the mistakes and changes that we made and use them as a way of improving.
