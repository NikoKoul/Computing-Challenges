# Computing-Challenges
This is a place to keep our attempts and track improvements on solutions. 

## Never commit to master!  
### Create a branch, start a PR (pull request), and ping a peer for code review.
### Then, and only then, merge into master.

I would encourage anyone participating to avoid using `--amend --no-edit` in most cases when committing changes so that we can all see 
the mistakes and changes that we made and use them as a way of improving.
